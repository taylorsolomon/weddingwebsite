        <h2>The Proposal</h2>

        <h3>How he proposed</h3>
        <p>To fully understand how Taylor proposed to Emily, we must go back to before they started dating and before they even went on their first date...
        <p>One Sunday after church in Fall 2013, Taylor went to a bar to watch a 49ers game with Emily and her roommate Sarah. Coincidentally, he had just finished making his first homebrewed beer, so he made sure to bring bottles for Emily and Sarah to try. Emily took the beer home with her and thought it was the best beer she had ever had and would ever have in her entire life. Although her friends laughed at her, she saved the beer bottle and tucked it away in her dresser because she knew there was something special about Taylor. Once she and Taylor officially started dating, the bottle sat on her dresser with a pink rose in it. Knowing this story, Taylor made sure to incorporate it into the proposal. <p>
        <p>The proposal happened on January 19th on the Georgetown Waterfront, where Taylor and Emily had their first date. They went to Baked and Wired, a cupcake store in Georgetown, and then walked down to the Waterfront. As they walked along the water, they arrived at an overlook where Taylor had asked his Best Man, Jaryd, to arrange twelve pink roses in beer bottles that were identical to the original bottle. Each rose had a tag around it with a reason Taylor loves Emily and wants to marry her, along with a corresponding Bible verse. </p>
        <p>Taylor’s best man Jaryd and his fiancé Laura hid in the bushes to capture this special moment.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, Emily said “yes”.</p>
</p></p>
        </p>"So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love."
        </p>1 Corinthians 13:13</p>
