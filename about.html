        <h2>The Proposal</h2>

        <h3>How he proposed</h3>
        <p>Before they started dating or went on their first date in Georgetown, Taylor brewed a beer and gave one to Emily. Emily thought it was the best beer she had ever had in her life. Although her friends laughed at her, she saved the beer bottle and tucked it away in her dresser. Once they started dating, the bottle sat on her dresser with a pink rose in it.</p>
        <p>Knowing this story, Taylor took twelve beer bottles that were identical to the original and put a pink rose in each bottle. On each rose, Taylor tied a card with a reason that He wanted to spend the rest of his life with Emily, twelve reasons in all, with a bible verse corresponding to each reason.</p>
        <p>Taylor’s best man Jaryd and his fiancé Laura set up the beer bottles on the Georgetown waterfront and then hid in the bushes to capture the proposal in action.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, Emily said “yes”.</p>
