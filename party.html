              <p>Allison and Emily met one glorious day in March 1990- March 8th, to be precise. While rumor has it Allison hid under the bed because Emily was coming home for the first time, she actually hid under the bed because she was afraid of the tow truck, not Emily. </p>

              <p>They grew up as the best of friends, playing school and Playmobil dollhouse. However, their favorite activity was sneakily watching The Little House of the Prairie while their mother was busy homeschooling their brother in the kitchen. </p>

              <p>Allison currently lives in Albany, New York, managing a doctor’s office and baking the most amazingly delicious &amp; intricately decorated cookies, cakes, &amp; cupcakes.</p>

              <p class='fact'>Fun fact: When she was two, Allison ate a ladybug. She can also be thanked for teaching Emily how to walk. </p>

              <p>Lauryn is married to Emily’s brother Tim. The first time Emily &amp; Lauryn met, they spent 8-hours in a car alone on their way to Penn State and subsequently got to know each other very well. Despite hating long car rides, Emily will always be thankful for that drive through rural PA.</p>

              <p>Lauryn is a Child Life Specialist and lives in Baltimore, Maryland, but will be moving to Boston in June for Tim’s residency. While Emily is sad that Tim and Lauryn will  be leaving the Mid-Atlantic, she has enjoyed the past three years of living near Lauryn and is very excited to visit Boston!</p>

              <p class='fact'>Fun fact: Lauryn can do the dance from the Pitch Perfect finale by heart.</p>

While Emily is very sad to lose such a close friend, she knows Sarah will go on to do amazing things and will eventually come back to D.C. to run the world.</p>

              <p class='fact'>Fun fact: Sarah can rap the entirety of “Gucci Gucci” by Kreayshawn and is an extremely passionate San Francisco 49ers and Giants fan. Don’t say anything bad about Bay Area sports teams around her, unless they are from Oakland. </p>
